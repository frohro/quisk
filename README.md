# Quisk Software Defined Radio by N2ADR
**December 26, 2023**

This is Quisk, a Software Defined Radio (SDR).
You supply radio hardware such as Hermes Lite2 or SoftRock to convert
the antenna voltage to I/Q samples.
Then send the samples to a computer running Quisk.
The Quisk software will read the I/Q data, tune it, filter it,
demodulate it, and send the audio to headphones or speakers.
Quisk has a microphone input and a key input so it can operate as a
complete transceiver.
